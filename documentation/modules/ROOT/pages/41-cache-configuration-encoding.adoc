= Cache Encoding
include::_attributes.adoc[]

Encoding is the format, identified by a media-type, that Data Grid uses to store entries (key/value pairs) in caches. You will have mainly two options: 

* *Protobuf*: To optimize speed, ensure interoperability, perform queries on the data, or use the web console to check the cache contents.
* *Java Serialization*: This option simplifies the configuration of the Java client and server with the disadvantage of losing the benefits of the previous option.


Let's define the encoding format for both the key and the value of all the entries of the cache by updating the cache definition with the following configuration:

[.console-input]
[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: infinispan.org/v2alpha1
kind: Cache
metadata:
  name: cluster-cache-replicated-01
spec:
  clusterName: cluster
  name:  cache-replicated-01
  template: |-
    replicatedCache:
      mode: "SYNC"
      statistics: "true"
      encoding:
        key:
          mediaType: application/x-protostream
        value:
          mediaType: application/x-protostream
  updates:
    strategy: recreate
----


Great! Now, access the web console again. Navigate to the cache and see that there is a new tab called `Entries`.

This tab allows you to explore the cached content and add new entries if you are allowed to. Try it now! If you cannot see the `Add entry` button, make sure that you are logged in as the `admin` user.
