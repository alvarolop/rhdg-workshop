== Prometheus metrics and Grafana.

* For both client and server side.
* List the most important metrics.

== In-line caching vs side caching.

== Openshift Helm Charts.

== Datasources with SQL Database.

== Authorization using RBAC.

== Access the DG cluster from outside

Two options for doing it from your laptop:

* expose through a Route.
* Use oc port-forward.

== Testing the cluster using the REST API

* Create three caches: one for Proto, one for Plain/text, one for JSON.
* Perform CRUD operations over all of them using the curl command.
* Perform a Query using REST to check that it works fine.

== Cross-site replication

Finally, we unravel the complexities of cross-site data replication within your cluster. This advanced feature ties together all the previous sections, showcasing how the cumulative knowledge gained contributes to a robust cache optimization strategy.
