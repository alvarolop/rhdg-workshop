= Basic Configuration
include::_attributes.adoc[]

Welcome to the next workshop segment! We'll start by mastering essential use cases, which serve as a stepping stone to tackling more intricate scenarios. Following that, we'll delve into the Infinispan CRD's configuration options, equipping you to optimize performance, fine-tune settings, and effectively safeguard your cache infrastructure.


TIP: Unless instructed, we expect you to execute all your exercises in the main namespace: `$USER-rhdg`.

[NOTE]
====
This workshop was prepared for the following versions of the infrastructure:

* Openshift version: 4.13.9
* RHDG operator version: 4.4.6
====


== First cluster

Kicking off your journey, let's build a strong foundation with the most basic Red Hat Data Grid setup. As you venture through each subsequent section, remember that these initial steps will serve as a reference point for the advanced concepts we'll delve into.

[.console-input]
[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: infinispan.org/v1
kind: Infinispan
metadata:
  name: cluster
  annotations:
    infinispan.org/monitoring: 'false'
spec:
  replicas: 1 <1>
  security: <2>
    endpointAuthentication: false
    endpointEncryption:
      type: None
  service: 
    container:
      ephemeralStorage: true <3>
    type: DataGrid <4>
----

<1> Only one replica for the simplest deployment.
<2> Disable both authentication and encryption.
<3> Don't request a PVC, as it won't be needed by now.
<4> `type: DataGrid` is the full version of the deployment with all the features.

After creating this CR in your namespace, you should see that the operator triggers the creation of several resources and after a few seconds, two pods will be running in your namespace:

* `cluster-0` is the real pod of Data Grid. It contains the server itself.
* `cluster-config-listener-...` is an auxiliary pod deployed per Data Grid cluster that synchronizes the cache configurations with the pods of a cluster to keep consistency. This pod is optional but recommended. We will take advantage of it in the following chapter.



.Did I Get It Right?
****
Access the logs to check that the Data Grid server is up and running. Either using the web console or the command line, access the logs of the pod `cluster-0`. You should see the following logs at the end:

[source, txt]
----
14:10:11,635 INFO (main) [org.infinispan.CLUSTER] ISPN000079: Channel `cluster` local address is `cluster-0-12182`, physical addresses are `[10.131.1.53:7800]`

== Web Console

Explore the 'Web Console' to gain insights into your configuration and the server performance. Easily access it by exposing it using an OCP route, providing an external window into your cache setup.

Let's modify the previous `Infinispan` object to add the route at the end of the previous YAML:

[.console-input]
[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: infinispan.org/v1
kind: Infinispan
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
# Here the previous YAML content #
  expose:
    annotations: {}
    type: Route
----

That's all! Wait less than a second and you should see a new route in your namespace. Use the following command if you don't find it:

[.console-input]
[source, bash]
----
# Modify the command according to your user.
oc get routes --template='http://{{(index .items 0).spec.host }}' 
----

Once you access the web console, you will see a welcome message. You just need to click on **Open the console**. 

.Data Grid web console welcome message

This is the main dashboard. Here, you can explore the configured caches, with their statistics, entries, configuration, etc. You can also check cluster configuration, like statistics and metrics, clustering, server version, `proto` files, counters, etc.

== Labels

As you progress through this workshop, it's time to explore how to apply labels to services and pods, enabling streamlined filtering based on these labels. Additionally, they can be utilized to enrich Prometheus metrics. 

You can check the labels of the cluster pods using the following command:

[.console-input]
[source, bash]
----
oc get pod cluster-0 -o jsonpath="{.metadata.labels}" | jq
----

[.console-output]
[source, bash]
----
{
  "app": "infinispan-pod",
  "app.kubernetes.io/created-by": "cluster",
  "clusterName": "cluster",
  "controller-revision-hash": "cluster-788688979",
  "infinispan_cr": "cluster",
  "rht.comp": "Data_Grid",
  "rht.comp_ver": "8.4.3",
  "rht.prod_name": "Red_Hat_Runtimes",
  "rht.prod_ver": "2023-Q2",
  "rht.subcomp_t": "application",
  "statefulset.kubernetes.io/pod-name": "cluster-0"
}
----


Now, add two new labels for the Infinispan CR, for example, `domain = bookshop` and `user = $YOUR_USER`:

[.console-input]
[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: infinispan.org/v1
kind: Infinispan
metadata:
  name: cluster
  labels:
    domain: bookshop
    user: userX
----

You will see that new labels where applied to your Infinispan CR, but not populated to the server pods:

[.console-input]
[source, bash]
----
oc get pod cluster-0 -o jsonpath="{.metadata.labels}" | jq
----


Therefore, we need to add extra annotations to instruct the operator to propagate those labels to pods and/or services. There are two:

* `infinispan.org/targetLabels` to label the services.
* `infinispan.org/podTargetLabels` to label the pods.

As we need them in the following exercises, let's add `domain` and `user` labels to the pods, but only `domain` to the services. 

[.console-input]
[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: infinispan.org/v1
kind: Infinispan
metadata:
  name: cluster
  annotations:
    infinispan.org/podTargetLabels: 'domain,user'
    infinispan.org/targetLabels: domain
    infinispan.org/monitoring: 'false'
  labels:
    domain: bookshop
    user: userX
----

This will automatically relabel the pods without restarting them:

[.console-input]
[source, bash]
----
oc get pod cluster-0 -o jsonpath="{.metadata.labels}" | jq
----

[.console-output]
[source, bash]
----
{
  "app": "infinispan-pod",
  "app.kubernetes.io/created-by": "cluster",
  "clusterName": "cluster",
  "controller-revision-hash": "cluster-788688979",
  "domain": "bookshop",
  "infinispan_cr": "cluster",
  "rht.comp": "Data_Grid",
  "rht.comp_ver": "8.4.3",
  "rht.prod_name": "Red_Hat_Runtimes",
  "rht.prod_ver": "2023-Q2",
  "rht.subcomp_t": "application",
  "statefulset.kubernetes.io/pod-name": "cluster-0",
  "user": "user1"
}
----


Great! You got it! Now, continue to the new section to explore all the resourcing configuration.
