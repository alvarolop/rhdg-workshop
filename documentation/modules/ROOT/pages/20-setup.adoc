[#access-cli]
== Access - OC Client

The OpenShift Container Platform CLI (which needs to be installed first) exposes the commands for managing your applications as well as the lower-level tools to interact with each component of your system. With the *oc* command, you can create applications and manage OpenShift Container Platform projects from a terminal.

Please check that you have followed the pre-requisites with your instructor and connect to the cluster executing the next command from your terminal:

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc login -u $YOUR_USER -p openshift $OCP_API
----

If the login is successful, it should show an output similar to the following screenshot:

.OC CLI Login Output

TIP: Please pay special attention to *oc CLI* because you will need to use this tool several times during this tutorial.
