The following CLI tools are *optional* for running the exercises in this tutorial. Although they are used in the tutorial, you could use others you are used to. *Do not worry about them, and install them when needed*. Please, read this information to decide if you need any of these tools:

* `curl` or an equivalent tool to perform REST requests is needed for all the chapters of the second day. 
* `jq` and `yq` are formatting tools that allow you to easily visualize the output of REST commands and oc CLI. I strongly recommend them if you will continuously use the `curl` command.
* `helm` is only needed for Helm Exercise, where you install a Data Grid cluster with Helm instead of the operator.
* Git and Podman are only needed if you want to replicate those deployments locally on your laptop.
