The following CLI tools are *optional* for running the exercises in this tutorial.
Although they are used in the tutorial, you could use others without any problem.

[WARNING]
====
* Only install Docker if you cannot use Podman.
* `jq` and `yq` are optional but very welcome. They prettify the output of the REST responses and will help you to understand the contents of the workshop better. `jq` works for JSON, while `yq` works for YAML and JSON.
* Don't install `curl` if you don't want to. In such case, you will need to adapt the commands to your own tool.
