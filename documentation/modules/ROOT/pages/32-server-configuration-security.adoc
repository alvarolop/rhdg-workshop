== Security I: Authentication

With the essentials in place, it's time to tighten security. As you learn to authenticate using the operator and OCP secret, keep in mind that this layer of protection is the springboard for the security enhancements to come.

// * Authentication using the operator and OCP secret.

== Security II: Authorization

Taking security up a notch, we add a crucial layer of authorization to the authentication setup. Keep these combined security measures in mind as you navigate through the more intricate security configurations.

// * Add authorization to the authentication of the previous section using the operator and OCP secret.


== Security III: Encryption

As we continue, the focus shifts to data protection. Whether you opt for OCP TLS certificates or custom ones, remember that encryption is pivotal for safeguarding your cache infrastructure and maintaining data integrity.



// We'll guide you through two distinct approaches: utilizing OCP TLS certificates and implementing custom TLS certificates. Elevate your cache security to the next level.

// * Using OCP TLS certificates or using custom TLS certificates.



== Wrap Up!

With each section, you gained a deeper understanding of key Red Hat Data Grid concepts, empowering you to optimize cache management and elevate your infrastructure expertise. Let's continue our journey of exploration and learning!
